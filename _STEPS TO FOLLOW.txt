For first assignment:
 I'm putting the steps here: 
1 Capture speech data using Cooledit software (16Khz, 16 bit and Mono channel) --- buffer
2 Correct the DC shift and normalize the data to + or -5000 (max)
3 Compute the ambient noise (noise floor)
4 Put markers on word_start and word_end
5 Place the segmented word in a file
6 Open this file and put data in an array
7 Generate the first frame and compute the Energy & ZCR
8 Do this for all the subsequent frames
9 Now based on the data generated, decide if the word is a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’.
10. Echo decision.

submit your first assignment (Yes/No detection ) through the link given below.
Folder name should be: rollno_yes_no.zip
